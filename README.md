# EC_582_Global
Course project materials for Economics of Globalization with Professor Anca Cristea, Winter 2020.


## Question at Issue
Is there a relationship between crime rates and attitudes toward globalization (eg. trade liberalization, immigration)?


## Data
County-level FBI UCR data 1960 - 2017.

County-level GSS data on public sentiment toward issues of globalization.
Search all GSS variables available here: https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter?utf8=%E2%9C%93&user_search_id=&state_id=&search_type=&keyword=&doslider=1&yrmin=1972&yrmax=2018&years=&subjects=&ssearch=&commit=SEARCH

* GSS data will limit timeframe because sentiment data was not collected in all years.


Measures of trade openness from the World Bank: https://data.worldbank.org/country/united-states and https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?end=2018&locations=US&start=1970&view=chart


Can I figure out a simple way to get this sentiment data in a processable form? https://www.pollingreport.com/trade.htm

## Literature

The role of sentiment in politics and more generally in situations where plenty of data is available to thoroughly refute our beliefs.

Consensus that levels of trade liberalization and immigration do not influence US crime rates.

## Changes over time
looking at:

murders per capita (in county-year)

mean and median on sentiment data in county-year


## Output
15-page paper
